# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

# Working with cell tracking data

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to find a work flow of how to deal with positional data of migrating and dividing nuclei (x,y,z, coordinates) obtained from live imaging movies of a developing embryo.

The methods I will use to do this are programming with python, which will allow me to pre-process the data (eg filtering it) and create some statistics.

The data I will use are my own data data and come from OpenSPIM live imaging movies in which nuclei have been traced using the Fiji plagun TrackMate. The data is publicly available under the following dropbox link:
