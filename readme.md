# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

# Working with and visualizing cell tracking data

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to optimize the work flow with positional data of nuclei (x,y,z, coordinates) obtained from live imaging movies.

The methods I will use to do this are programming with python, which will allow me to pre-process the data (eg filtering it) and create some statistics.

The data I will use are my own data data and come from OpenSPIM live imaging movies in which nuclei have been traced using the Fiji plagun TrackMate. The data is publicly available under the following dropbox link:
