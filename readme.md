# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![Figure 1](./Figure1.png?raw=true)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Working with and visualizing cell tracking data

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to optimize the work flow with positional data of nuclei (x,y,z, coordinates) obtained from live imaging movies.

The methods I will use to do this are programming with python, which will allow me to pre-process the data (eg filtering it) and create some statistics.

The data I will use are my own data data and come from OpenSPIM live imaging movies in which nuclei have been traced using the Fiji plagun TrackMate. The data is publicly available under the following dropbox link:
